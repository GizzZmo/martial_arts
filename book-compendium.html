                    <h3 id="methodology">Methodology for Selection</h3>
                    <p>This compendium presents a curated list of known martial arts books, aiming for breadth and significance. The selection prioritizes works that are historically important, authored by foundational masters or leading scholars, represent key research, or are widely recognized as essential texts within specific martial traditions. The information is drawn from the entirety of the reviewed research material. While the user's query mentioned "all known books," such an exhaustive list is impractical due to the sheer volume of martial arts literature. Therefore, this section focuses on providing a robust, representative, and high-value selection. ISBNs are included where available from the source materials to aid in locating specific editions.</p>
                    
                    <p>A comprehensive understanding of any martial art often benefits from engaging with three broad categories of literature: primary historical documents that offer direct insight into original techniques and philosophies; the codified teachings and autobiographical reflections of art founders and key modern masters; and contemporary scholarly analyses or encyclopedic overviews that contextualize and synthesize this knowledge. This compendium is structured to reflect these categories, guiding the reader toward a balanced collection. Certain texts, due to their historical impact, the authority of their authors, or their comprehensive nature, have achieved a "classic" or "canonical" status within martial arts literature. Their frequent appearance across diverse bibliographies and recommendations underscores their widely accepted value, making them essential starting points for serious study.</p>
